What is EPUB?
=============

I'm trying to figure out what the EPUB format is - especially EPUB3 compared to
EPUB2 - they seem like they're very similar, so there would be an advantage in
inspecting both.

EPUB3 changes from EPUB2
------------------------

The following URL explains the differences from version 3 to 2(.0.1):

Basically
---------

An .epub file is just a zip archive obeying a certain "structure". Apparently
the "internal" structure of the actual book doesn't matter so much, as long as
links are correct throughout. 

There are several goals here: One of the first goals is to write an
EPUB document entirely from scratch (a very small document). This
resource provides a bunch of EPUB 3 files to play with:

  https://code.google.com/p/epub-samples/  

A second goal is to explore the svg format, and its HTML support.

Structure of the .epub file
---------------------------

The basic layout of an EPUB file is the following:

  mimetype
  META-INF/
    container.xml

### The mimetype file

The mimetype file, simply an extension-less file with the name
'mimetype', contains the text:

  application/epub+zip

which is the EPUB mimetype.

### META-INF

The most important file in the META-INF folder is the 'container.xml'
file (Why, I don't know).

Package Document (.opf)
-----------------------

The package document describes the overall structure of the ebook. It
has the mimetype 'application/oebps-package+xml

The 'package' element is the root container of the package
document. It has the following attributes:

 - version: The EPUB version that the publication conforms
   	    to. Must have the value "3.0" for EPUB3.
 - unique-identifier: An IDREF that identifies the 'dc:identifier'
 - xml:lang (optional): Specifies the contents and attribute values

The package element can contain the following elements (in the
indicated order):

 - metadata (required):
 - manifest (required): The manifest section lists all the files that
   are part of the publication, each represented by an <item>.

   An item MUST have attributes id, href and media-type, for example:

     <item id="intro" href="introduction.html" media-type="application/xtml" />

   declares that 'introduction.html' is part of this publication, that
   it's a HTML file and we've given it the id 'intro'.

 - spine (required): The spine element defines the default reading of
   the EPUB, by a list of <itemref> elements.

   An itemref has only 'idref' as a required attribute, for example:

     <itemref idref="intro" [linear="yes|no"] [id="..."] [properties="p1 p2"] />

   The other properties are usually not so interesting.
 - guide (optional/deprecated): The <guide> element has been
   deprecated.
 - bindings (optional): TBD.


What I want to accomplish
-------------------------
Goal 0: Write an .epub file from scratch, no generator whatsoever. Completed.
        The result is in 'hello-epub'.

Goal 1: Explore possibilites for SVG in EPUB

Goal 2: Explore possibilities for MathML in EPUB

Goal 3: Explore possibilities for conversion from LaTeX to html/epub
        (something).
