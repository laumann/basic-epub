    <h1>Plan of Attack</h1>
    <p>The following is the plan of attack I plan to (sort of)
    follow - at the very least it's a list of topics that I want
    to touch upon in relation to EPUB</p>

    <ul>
      <li>EPUB 3 file format (<code>.epub</code>)</li>
      <li>SVG in EPUB
	<ul>
	  <li>Graphviz <code>dot</code> supports output to svg</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><code>epub:type</code> and its attributes. A good reference
      would be: <code>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/</code></li>
      <li>MathML in EPUB</li>
      <li>LaTeX conversion to EPUB (probably via HTML)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All this should hopefully amount to some sort useful
    output. The primary idea is to create a tool for working with
    EPUB files a la Jekyll, where generation of required (simple)
    files could be automatised to a great degree. Some of these </p>

    <p>But all this is configurable, and needs to be so. For instance,
    EPUB doesn't care what your <code>.opf</code> file is called, as
    long as the file specified in <code>META-INF/container.xml</code>
    exists (and has the correct format). For instance,
    the <code>mimetype</code> file must be the first file in the
    archive. so some kind of control over the order of packaging is
    required.</p>
