    <h1>Hello EPUB!</h1>
    <p>This is my introductory text on EPUB (3) written entirely from
    scratch, and zipped manually. Why would anyone want to do this?
    Well, first of all, I want to understand the EPUB
    format. Secondly, I can't find any <em>good</em> texts on
    EPUB(3), and most editing programs freely available only speak
    EPUB 2.</p>

    <p>I'm also slightly afraid that my Sony Reader(TM) does not
    get EPUB 3, although I know for a fact this it supports SVG, but
    I'm not entirely sure on MathML (which I'd be really interested in).</p>
